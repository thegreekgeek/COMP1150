        "* **Design**\n",
        ">Software design describes how a program will fulfill its requirements. It defines the necessary classes, objects, their interactions, and relationships. Low-level design focuses on how individual methods perform specific tasks.\n",
        ">\n",
        ">Just as a civil engineer wouldn’t build a bridge without a blueprint, software should never be developed without proper design. Many software issues stem from poor or rushed design, and investing time in design upfront often saves time and cost later.\n",

        "* **Implementation**\n",
        "> Implementation is the process of writing source code to translate a software design into a working program using a specific programming language.

        "**OOP** provides a natural and powerful way to model real-world systems in software. It helps bridge the gap between the **requirements** (what the system should do) and the **implementation** (how it does it) by using objects that bundle data and behavior together. In fact, **OOP** allows you to represent things in your programs in a way that closely mirrors the real world.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Most conventional programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++, support object-oriented programming. However, some languages—such as C, Haskell, and earlier versions of FORTRAN—do not natively support this paradigm.\n",

For example, if you want to model a `Car`, you could create a class with attributes like `color` and `speed`, and methods like `drive()` and `brake()`. While you can create a class without methods, it wouldn’t be very useful—just like a car without any functionality.\n",
        "\n",
        "An **object**, on the other hand, is a specific instance of a class. It represents a concrete example that follows the structure and behavior defined by the class.
