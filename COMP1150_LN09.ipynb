        "\n",
        "Programming is basically giving your computer commands to perform tasks for you. While this is not the most technical definition, it is a pretty accurate one. More formally, programming refers to the process of writing instructions that computers can understand. These instructions are written in a programming language, which act as a bridge between the human thought and computer operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming Languages are formal languages designed for communicating instructions to computers. Examples of programming languages includes Java, C++, JavaScript, Python and many more. In this class, we will how to write simple programs using Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Programming allows you to:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Automate tasks to save time.\n",
        "* Create software, from simple scripts to complex applications.\n",
        "* Solve problems by breaking them down into manageable steps.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the core of programming are algorithms—step-by-step procedures for solving problems and processing data. Writing efficient algorithms is like crafting the perfect recipe in a cooking competition: every ingredient and step matters.\n",
        "\n",
        "<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "**Formal Language vs Natural Language**\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like following a precise recipe in cooking, communicating with computers requires structured, unambiguous languages designed for giving clear instructions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is a formal language?**\n",
        "A formal language is a set of strings of symbols from a predefined alphabet, governed by specific syntactical rules, used to represent information or instructions in a structured and unambiguous way.\n",
        "\n",
        "Formal languages are the foundation of computer programming. Python, which we will use in this course, is one example. Others include Java, C++, and JavaScript. Each of these languages has its own syntax—the set of rules that defines how we structure commands. If you break these rules, your program won’t run correctly, or at all.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the following comparison between natural languages and formal languages:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Feature               | Natural Languages (e.g., English)   | Formal Languages (e.g., Python)  |\n",
        "|-----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------|\n",
        "| **Ambiguity**          | Often ambiguous (e.g., \"run\" can mean many things) | No ambiguity; every statement has a clear, singular meaning |\n",
        "| **Context Sensitivity**| Relies heavily on context for understanding | Context-free; each instruction stands alone and must follow strict rules |\n",
        "| **Flexibility**        | Flexible; grammar rules can be broken or bent | Inflexible; every error in syntax results in failure |\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In a natural language like English, it’s possible to say things in many different ways and still be understood. You could say, \"Let's get going,\" \"We should start,\" or even \"It’s time to move,\" and the meaning is the same. A human listener understands the intent behind your words, even if your phrasing changes or isn’t grammatically perfect.\n",
        "\n",
        "With a formal language like Python, this isn’t possible. Computers cannot guess your intentions—they only understand the exact instructions you give them.  For example, look at these two Python statements:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "print(\"Welcome to COMP 1150!\")\n",
        "print(\"Welcome to cOMP 1150!\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "Though the two looks almost identical to a human, Python treats them differently. The first statement prints \"Welcome to COMP 1150!\" with capitalized 'C', while the second prints \"Welcome to cOMP 1150!\"  with lowercase 'C'. This precision is why programming requires a clear understanding of the formal language being used.\n",
        "\n",
        " **Syntax and Semantics**\n",
        "\n",
        " **Syntax**\n",
        "\n",
        " In formal languages, **syntax** refers to the rules for structuring commands—like grammar in English. For example, Python requires parentheses in the print statement:\n",
        "\n",
        " ```python\n",
        "print(\"Welcome to COMP 1150!\") # This is syntactically correct in Python\n",
        "print \"Welcome to cOMP 1150!\" # This is wrong and will cause error because of the missing parentheses.\n",
        "```\n",
        "**Semantics**\n",
        "\n",
        "Semantics refers to the meaning of those commands. Even with correct syntax, the program can still produce incorrect results if the logic is wrong. For instance, multiplying instead of adding two numbers would be a semantic error.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Syntax is correct, but logic is wrong\n",
        "temperature_in_fahrenheit = 32\n",
        "# Intent was to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius, but used the wrong formula\n",
        "temperature_in_celsius = (temperature_in_fahrenheit - 32) * 2  # Incorrect formula\n",

        "sudo apt-get install python3 for Ubuntu/Debian.\n",
        "sudo yum install python3 for CentOS/Fedora.\n",

        "5. Verify Installation:\n",
        "Open a command prompt or terminal and type python --version or python3 --version (for Linux/macOS where Python 2 might also be installed). You should see the version number of Python installed.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process gives you a basic Python setup. Remember, for development, you might also want to install pip, Python's package installer, which often comes bundled with Python but can be installed separately if needed.\n"
